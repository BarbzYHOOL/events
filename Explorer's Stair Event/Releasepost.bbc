[b][size=6]Explorer's Stair Event[/size][/b]

Stair events are often boring, but not this one! After a few simple jumps the players are taken through an underwater tunnel, followed by a confusing path of spirals, jumps and elevators. If they survive the first part, they can start their travel through the mountains to the sorcerer's tower. Don't be misguided by the pretty environment though, a simple misstep can quickly lead to a character's death.

After passing through the tower, players are taken to a large platform. This is to make sure a mistake at the end doesn't force them to start all over. The platform serves as some kind of checkpoint. At this platform starts the very last but also most tricky part of the stair event. Luckily a nice prize is waiting for them at the sky pirate ship above (or not, but that part is up to you ;)).

[*]Players running the stair will need a somewhat decent computer. The large amount of visual effects in this event is known to cause issues on some older setups.[/list]
This event will definitely not work for cataclysm or higher, due to a different layout of the area and because of flying being enabled. It might work on vanilla and TBC, but that has not yet been tested.

If you run the event on your server, I'd appreciate if you could make some screenshots or videos and send them to me (gmgenie [at] chocochaos [dot] com).

[b][size=6]Reposts and modifications[/size][/b]

Since Explorer's Stair Event is under an open source license (GPLv3), any modifications and redistributions of the SQL are explicitly allowed, as long as copyright and license notices remain intact.

However, I would appreciate it if you could drop me a message if you post/publish this event somewhere. Partly because I like to know where it is being spread, but also so I can add new versions to those threads when they are released. It would be a shame if everyone keeps using some ancient version because it was once posted on a forum, and never updated there.

You can drop me an e-mail at gmgenie [at] chocochaos [dot] com

It's not a requirement to inform me, but I would appreciate it =)
